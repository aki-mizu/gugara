It emerged quite spontaneously when a few bitcoinerrak (Bitcoin enthusiasts) came together‚Äîmostly through that wonderful tool, Nostr‚Äîto stay connected, share knowledge and experiences, and learn from one another through studying and using different tools.\n\nThere‚Äôs no defined structure; we rely on staying connected with each other both online and through regular meetups. On the one hand, we share what each of us is working on and what topics we‚Äôd like to talk about. On the other hand, we hold group discussions during our meetups, sharing progress and diving into specific topics we've agreed on.\n\nThis ongoing contact enables cooperation and helps address needs within the group. Everyone contributes what they can, and in doing so, we gradually build an infrastructure that‚Äôs available to everyone."
